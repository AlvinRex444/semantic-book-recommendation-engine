# semantic-book-recommendation-engine
Book recomendation-engine for rating of books for content based searches with vector searches through FAISS

Designed and developed a high-performance semantic recommendation system that retrieves contextually similar books using transformer-generated embeddings and Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search.
Unlike traditional keyword-based systems, this engine understands semantic relationships, enabling significantly more relevant recommendations.
